# 01 Homework Activity - Marketing Agency

## CSS
This tasks mainly involved consolidating a lot of the CSS file. There were excess amounts of IDs used, each with the same formating. These were consolidated into single IDs or Classes. 

## HTML
In the HTML, there was again excessive tagging of Class and ID selectors, I removed as many double ups as possible. Many of the elements had both Class and ID selectors. 

The meta title was updated, along with responsive device design added.
